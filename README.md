# CPP-Exercises Repo Explanation
This is a repo to store any C++ exercise code that I worked on. 
Feel free to suggest new ideas, make contributions, and use the codes.

This repo includes only the source codes. It is user's responsibility to compile and run the code.
If there are any dependencies, it must have been explained in the comments.

For libraries, the functions and all other stuff is documented with doxygen.
