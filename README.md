# CPP-Exercises Repo Explanation
This is a repo to store any C++ exercise code that I worked on. 
Feel free to suggest new ideas, make contributions and use the codes.

This repo includes only the source codes. It is user's duty to compile and run the code.
If there are any dependincies, it must be explained in the comments.
